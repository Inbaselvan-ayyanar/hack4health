# MediMesh UI Sketch
Designed by Yuvadarshan ðŸŽ¨ for accessibility, built with React and Tailwind CSS in my-react-app.

## Layout
- **Header**: Centered title ("MediMesh India"), points display ("Points: 50") in white on black background.

  2. **Pharmacy Finder**: Search bar, list of PMBJP pharmacies (name, location, meds) in white cards.
  3. **Adherence Tracker**: Inputs for med name/time, blue "Add Reminder" button, reminder list with green "Mark Taken" links.
  4. **Adherence Circles**: White cards with community tips (e.g., "Take meds with water").
  5. **Drug Tutorial System**: Large input for prescription, blue "Submit" button. Tutorial displays usage, side effects, precautions, and 100x100px AI-generated images (e.g., syringe steps) with captions.
  6. **Notification System**: Yellow pop-up with large green "Yes" and red "No" buttons, flashes every 1s for hearing-impaired.
  7. **Adherence Report**: Blue "Generate Report" button, white card with metrics (adherence %, missed doses, suggestions).
- **Footer**: None (maximizes screen space for mobile).
